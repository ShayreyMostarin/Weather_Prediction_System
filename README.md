# Weather_Prediction_System

Weather forecasting is the attempt by meteorologists to predict the weather conditions at some future time and the weather conditions that may be expected. Any weather prediction needs a systematic collection of weather record of various places and proper analysis using the data for prediction. The climatic condition parameters are based on the temperature, wind, humidity, and size of data set. The correlation analysis of the parameters helps in predicting the future values. Here, the parameters temperature and Humidity only are considered for experimental analysis. The data is collected from the temperature and humidity sensor called DHT11 sensor, which helps in detecting the temperature and humidity values of a particular region or location.   Machine Learning model that gives better results for time-series data is used for predicting the values for forthcoming. It is a very interesting and challenging task. This report provides a basic understanding of the purpose and scope of weather forecasts, the basic principles and the general models for forecasting.
